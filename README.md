This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where using an overly minimalistic base image (like `alpine:latest`) leads to dependency conflicts. The original Dockerfile uses `alpine:latest` causing the build to fail, likely due to incompatibility between Python and the system's libraries. The solution provided uses a more robust base image that includes essential components to avoid this issue, ensuring a smoother and more reliable build process.
